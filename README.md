# zeko.party (2022-2023)

this is the old version of [my personal website](https://zeko.party/). you can see how i did stuff if you're interested.
it uses a fairly old version of sveltekit, so it might not work nowadays if you update any packages.

i didn't like how complex it looked (but also that i haven't updated it in a year now lol), so the current version (>= 2024) is a lot more simple.
also i don't think i remember telling anyone that theres a menu if you hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> too haha.
